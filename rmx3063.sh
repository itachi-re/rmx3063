#  WARNING: THIS SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR RMX3063 PHONE.
#
#  Your phone has Dynamic Partitions (`super.img`) but BLOCKS access
#  to the required `fastbootd` mode. Therefore, the `fastboot flash super`
#  command is guaranteed to fail with a "partition not found" or
#  similar error.
#
#  This script is provided for educational purposes only to show what
#  the commands would look like.
#
#  YOU MUST USE THE SP FLASH TOOL SCRIPT TO FLASH YOUR PHONE.
